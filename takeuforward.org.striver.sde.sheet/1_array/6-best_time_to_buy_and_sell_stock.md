[Note]()

Very important to know space optimization
>  

---
#### 1. Best time to buy and sell stock  
arr []  = [ 7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
n number of days 
decide a day when you buy stock and decide a day when you sell stock
buy ➡️ 1
sell ➡️ 6
so, profit ➡️ 5 you have to maximize the profit

> Give Importance on space optimization .. 

#### Better Solution  

```
If you are selling on iTh day,
you buy on the minimum price from 1st ➡️ (i-1)

```

```ts
/*********
 * Sudo code
 * ******/

minimum = a[0]
for(){
    const = a[i] - minimum ;
    profit = max(profit, cost)
    minimum = min(minimum, a[i])
}

/***********
 * 
 * time complexity : O(n)
 * space complexity : O(1)
 * 
 * 
 * dynamic programming ::
 *  -> remembering the past .. here we keep remembering the minimum
 * ******/


```
