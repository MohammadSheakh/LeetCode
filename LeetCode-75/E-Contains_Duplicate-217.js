/**
  * @Steps <!--    -->
  |
  |--> 1. 
  | 2. brute force solution
        since we have to check for every number .. 
        time complexity is O(n^2) 
        space complexity is O(1) // as we dont need any extra memory 
  
  | 3. better solution
        sorting 
        | as duplicate will be next to each other
        | so we can just check if current number is equal to next number
        | so we just need to iterate through the array once 
        time complexity o(n log n)
        space complexity O(1) // as we dont need any extra memory
