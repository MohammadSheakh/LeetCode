    |         then its left child is at index 2*i + 1
    |         and its right child is at index 2*i + 2.
    |         and its parent is at index (i-1)/2

/**
  * @Steps <!--  Array representation of binary tree  -->
  |
  |--> 1. if a tree has no missing nodes, then it is called a complete binary tree.
    |         and it is also called a full binary tree.
    |         and it is also called a perfect binary tree.
    |         and it is also called a balanced binary tree.
