    RDBMS ..
    NoSQL .. are designed to handle not only SQL, structure and semi structured data and unstructured data

    RDBMS - suitable for applications that require complex transactions, data integrity (ACID)..
    such as banking, finance, e-commerce... 
    
    NoSql - designed for handle large volumes of data, high read and write operations..  such as 
    social media, big data analytics, real-time applications, content management systems...

/**
  * @NEW_TOPIC <!-- Document and Collection in NoSql -->
    
    Document - a single record in a NoSQL database, typically represented in JSON format.
    Collection - a group of related documents in a NoSQL database, similar to a table in RDBMS.


    //////////// How to connect  to mongo db server from Node.js applications .. 

    Mongo db can be connected from Node by calling the connect method of MongoClient class .. 

    /////////// What are query operator in Mongo db . V imp

    {field : {$query_operator : value }}
    query operators are special keywords or symbols used to perform operations like
    comparison, logical operations in queries ..  

    ////////// What is projection in mongo db 

    Projection is the process of selecting specific fields from a document in a query result.
    It allows you to control which fields are returned in the query result, reducing the amount of
    data transferred over the network and improving query performance.

    ////////// what is indexes in mongo db? how indexing make data retrieval faster ? 

    mongo db automatically updates the index tree as documents are inserted, updated, or deleted..
    ensuring the index remains accurate  and up to date ..

/**
  * @NEW_TOPIC <!-- What is mongoose? what are the advantages of using it -->
    Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
    It provides a schema-based solution to model application data, making it easier to work with MongoDB.
    Advantages of using Mongoose include:
    1. Schema Validation: Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your data, ensuring
         that the data adheres to a specific structure and type.
    2. Middleware: Mongoose supports middleware functions that can be executed before or after certain operations,
            such as saving or validating documents.
    3. Query Building: Mongoose provides a powerful query builder that allows you to construct complex queries
            using a fluent API.
    4. Population: Mongoose supports population, which allows you to reference documents in other collections
            and automatically populate the referenced documents in query results.
    5. Model Methods: Mongoose allows you to define custom methods on models, making it easier to encapsulate
            business logic related to the data.
    6. Plugins: Mongoose supports plugins, which allow you to extend the functionality of models and schemas
            by adding reusable functionality.
    7. Connection Management: Mongoose provides built-in connection management, making it easier to connect
            to MongoDB and handle connection errors.

    8. Query Hooks: Mongoose provides hooks that allow you to execute custom logic before or after certain
            operations, such as saving or removing documents.

    9. Type Casting: Mongoose automatically casts values to the appropriate types defined in the schema,    
            ensuring data consistency.

    10. Virtuals: Mongoose allows you to define virtual properties that are not stored in the database but can
            be computed based on other fields in the document.
    11. Aggregation: Mongoose provides support for MongoDB's aggregation framework, allowing you to perform
            complex data transformations and analysis directly within your application.

    12. Transactions: Mongoose supports transactions, allowing you to perform multiple operations atomically
            across multiple collections, ensuring data integrity.

    13. Error Handling: Mongoose provides a consistent error handling mechanism, making it easier to handle
            validation errors, connection errors, and other exceptions that may occur during database operations.

    14. Query Caching: Mongoose supports query caching, allowing you to cache query results for improved
            performance and reduced database load.

    15. Schema Inheritance: Mongoose supports schema inheritance, allowing you to create base schemas
            and extend them with child schemas, promoting code reuse and modularity.

    16. Lean Queries: Mongoose provides the ability to perform lean queries, which return plain JavaScript
            objects instead of Mongoose documents, improving performance when you don't need the full
            functionality of Mongoose documents.

    17. Custom Validators: Mongoose allows you to define custom validation functions for fields in your schema,
            enabling you to implement complex validation logic that goes beyond built-in validators.
    18. Query Chaining: Mongoose supports query chaining, allowing you to build complex queries by chaining
            multiple query methods together, making it easier to construct and execute queries in a readable manner.    


    19. Schema Options: Mongoose provides various schema options that allow you to customize the behavior
            of your schemas, such as timestamps, versioning, and default values.
    20. Query Population: Mongoose supports query population, allowing you to automatically populate
            referenced documents in query results, making it easier to work with related data.
